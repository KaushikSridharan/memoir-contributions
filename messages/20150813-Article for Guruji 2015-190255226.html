I look at him and he looks right into my eyes and smiles.&nbsp; I maintain eye contact with him and move to the chair directly in front of him and say “Guruji, may I give you something?”&nbsp; He nods yes so I hand him the envelope that says on the front “To Guruji, for your approval”.&nbsp; I say “I’ve made some puzzle books using your books as the answer keys.&nbsp; They are a fun way for people to learn Sanskrit”.&nbsp; He takes the package and says “I will see” and I even say something else but don’t’ remember what because I’m so nervous.&nbsp; He sits the package to the side.&nbsp; I thank him and take my book to the librarian and as I’m leaving I bow down to him and thank him again.&nbsp; I’m ready to hop out of there I’m so happy to be finally leaving the library without the puzzle books!&nbsp; So the next day I receive a letter from Guruji&nbsp; He says “It is really a fascinating idea to have brought out this project in the form of puzzles, and I am sure this is bound to create lot of interest not only in the minds of the students of yoga, but also the lovers of yoga....I am sure you have started a good work and I hope it would be appreciated by all which give them time to sit and work on puzzles with patience and tolerance”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of days later I run into Paul Cabanis and Marla Apt and they tell me that Guruji was showing them the puzzle books in the library.&nbsp; He says he went on about them for about five minutes and he really liked them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marla added that it was real cute because Guruji was thinking of ways they could be used by teachers preparing for assessment, and for children and how people could play puzzles for entertainment instead of watching tv! Later that day I&nbsp;went to the library to thank Guruji for my letter.&nbsp; At first&nbsp;I didn’t’ think he recognized me but I showed him the letter and he said “oh yes, you are doing good work”.&nbsp; For me, those words&nbsp;made me so happy!&nbsp; It&nbsp;made all my nervous hours in the library worthwhile just to hear that!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his birthday celebration we all lined up to pay homage and when I bowed in front of him he said again, “you are doing good work”.&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep his words in my heart and mind each day as I practice and teach and cook meals and live my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m so thankful that he smiled at me that day and gave me the opening I needed to move to him instead of shy away!&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Guruji!<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">By Nancy Roberts<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Santa Barbara, CA<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Intermediate Jr II<o:p></o:p></span></p><br><font style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font></font>&nbsp;<br><font style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wishing you health and happiness,<br><br></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">Namaste,<br><br></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nancy Roberts</font></font><br><strong>Visit my website:&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#2672ec" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><u>h</u></font></strong><a href="http://www.nancylynnroberts.com/" target="_blank"><font color="#2672ec" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><strong>ttp://www.nancylynnroberts.com</strong></font></a>&nbsp;<br>To learn about my yoga puzzle books, visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://yogawordpuzzles.com/" target="_blank">http://yogawordpuzzles.com</a><br><em>And if you'd like to have some help with your yoga&nbsp;practice, download my app for the I-Phone/i-Pad:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Yoga Practice on the Go</strong>.&nbsp; See it in the Apple Store and download the restorative class for free!</em><br><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yoga-practice-on-the-go/id637562911?mt=8" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yoga-practice-on-the-go/id637562911?mt=8</a><br><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br><br><br><br><font style="font-size:12pt;"><font face="Comic Sans MS"></font></font>&nbsp;<br><br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
