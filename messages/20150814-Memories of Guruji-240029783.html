<div dir="ltr">Hello - here is a copy of the talk I gave at the Melbourne convention last year after Guruji died. <div>I&#39;m afraid the beginning talks a bit about how I came to study with him and gives a little insight as to what it was like to come and study there in the 70&#39;s.</div><div>Perhaps the last page where I talk about being in the library is best.</div><div><br></div><div>Have you seen the old black and white (and some color slides) on my Facebook page in the Guruji album? </div><div>My husband and I took over 200 photos between 1976 to 1979 and some are really wonderful of Guruji and RIMYI from that era.  All the black and white ones were scanned here in Sydney and I gave them to Stephanie on a flash drive.  They are there at the Institute in the computer room.  I would love it if you would use some of them.<br></div><div><br></div><div>At the Abhijata convention here recently some of the students arranged to make prints of some of the photos and sell them.  They raised quite a lot of money and I am to use this to make a book of the prints.  I am hoping to have a prototype ready when I come in February next year.  The idea is to have the photos plus short comments (up to a paragraph or so) written by people who were there studying in the 70&#39;s.  All proceeds to go to Bellur.</div><div><br></div><div>If I can be of any service to you, please let me know.</div><div><br></div><div>All the best,</div><div><br></div><div>Julia Pedersen</div><div>Sydney</div><div><br></div><div>PS I will send a few of the old photos in a separate email.</div></div>
