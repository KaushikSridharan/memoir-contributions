<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Written August 20, 2014</span><div><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Oh Guru my guru </span></div><div><br></div><div><div><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">To some he was like a father figure, to me he was like a grandfather figure.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I met him for the first time in my dreams and then that very same year I prostrated to him in person.  He kept visiting me in my dreams up until I met him in person.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Never did I ever think I would meet him. All of the grueling hard work I went through to get to RIMYI was well worth doing sastanga namaskar- full body prostration, to the man who saved me from a mundane life. I didn&#39;t care that I was wearing a nice salwar or that girls don&#39;t usually lay on the floor in full prostration. When I came up from pranam he said very sincerely &#39;May God bless you&#39;.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I had planned out what I would say to him in Marathi but when the time came he didn&#39;t seem to understand my accent. Luckily, he understood ladoo and chocolates and smiled.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I had always felt his presence was with me, guiding me although we had never met.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">He came often to visit me in my dreams. The day I took over my studio he came to visit it in my dreams, pleased that I had it.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Heh Pitamah- oh grandfather at a time when my life was full of twisted roads leading nowhere you showed me how to connect somewhere- to the Universe through yog. And that yog has always supported me and lead me back to you and your method.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I remember watching you working at your desk from the 2nd floor windows before early morning class.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I remember watching you from the practice hall as you sat reading on your porch. Of course you knew someone was watching you and sheepishly I ducked. Embarrassed at my enrapture.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I remember the last words you said when I was leaving as I bowed my head to your feet and I told you I would be back. &quot;Narayana, Narayana&quot;</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I loved sitting in the library in the afternoons and listening to your exchange with students and visitors.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Oh guru my guru</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I was sad when you could no longer make downstairs to the library and I remember how eerie it was to be there, your presence missing.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Oh guru my guru</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">My first visit I came in November and happily on my birthday put a garland around the statue of your beloved Ramamani, as we have the same birthday. I finally felt at home inside the gates on Hari Krishna Mandir Road, passing through with Pranams - Shri Ganeshaya Namah, Shri Krishnaya Namah, Shri Nandi Gai ko Namah, Shri Patanjali ko Namah, Shri Saraswatye Namah...as I made my way down the path to enter the building.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">My last dream of you, you came to my studio and were pleased at the work I was doing with students. But it wasn&#39;t you, it was your younger self. Sitting on the floor in Janu Sirsasana or was it Dandasana? I cannot remember, only that I was confused as to why your younger self was visiting me and why not you with your white hair and grandfatherly self.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Oh guru my guru</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">All alone where I live your dreams kept me in touch.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">I feel unsettled now that you are gone, on the verge of tipping a very fine balance. I force myself to practice, staring up at the ceiling and wondering if I will ever meet you again, now if only just in my dreams.</span><br style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Oh guru my guru</span><br></div></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12.8000001907349px">Amita Bhagat </span></div></div>
