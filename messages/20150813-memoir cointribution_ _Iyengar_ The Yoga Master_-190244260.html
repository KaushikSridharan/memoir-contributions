<DIV>Hello,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Please find my&nbsp;humble contribution to Guruji's Memoir underneath.</DIV>
<DIV>Thanking you.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>________________________________________________</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>In 2007 I had the great pleasure of producing the book "Iyengar: The Yoga Master".&nbsp; I have to smile, </SPAN>looking back on it, that it took so long to come up with that title ... but then ... "Much Ado About Nothing" and "As You Like It" are evidence that even such a&nbsp;supreme master as Shakespeare sometimes had a problem with titles. <SPAN id=x942e650a27d2481fbfb667ea4c8645be>But like Guruji himself, 'master' has much power and subtlety. It is so much deeper than it originally appears. Also like Guruji, it has proved a very flexible and versatile word that has nevertheless maintained a strong core vitality.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN>It is surely no surprise to anyone to learn that one origin for master is the <SPAN id=xc87fd56b0fe84ea7845fe081d8f80668>Latin 'magister'. It might, however, be a little more surprising to know that another is the Middle English 'maistr' or 'maegester'. None of that tells us, however, the real meaning: the sense conveyed by those terms.</SPAN></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN><SPAN>It is again no surprise that by the fourteenth century, in Europe, a <SPAN id=x899cccb8263a4b149fe7c2e9864dc778>master was one granted the authority to teach, and whose teachings others also accept and follow. This was the case for Guruji once his own Beloved Guru, Krishnamacharya, had charged him with going to Pune to instruct others. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Master is also </SPAN>the root of <SPAN id=x470384697be6496285ce4988d9338890>'magi' ... those wise men who came from the East, and "who are greater than all others", which was certainly true for BKS Iyengar when, in 1956, and at the invitation of Yehudi Menuhin, <SPAN id=xcdcee2ec82124525a9ecafb1b717dbeb>he first went to the West to teach</SPAN>. And in&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN id=xeb77df395b424129a61e0c954984835b>1904, with the advent of our more technological era, master also came to mean the original source -- as in master disc -- from which all others come: something that certainly applies to we who are the legion of pupils teaching in his name. That references the eighth century usage for it makes him the master of us all. It also of course <SPAN id=x1fb936197b144149932c471270028661>means the head of a household, as he is head of this one. <SPAN id=xe99b552784794e5d9b275a1fee92bf40>Master is also the origin for 'magus', that Renaissance magician, the alchemist, who searched for the philosopher's stone, and who experimented ceaselessly, as Guruji also did, to turn the <SPAN id=xe93b8d704b75487fbe5106c34250a2b4>base into pure gold, and to find </SPAN>the true elixir of life.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></DIV>
<DIV><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>All of course immediately <SPAN id=xdbf538f673a440c796940ace70d96db2>understood, from that book title, that Sri BKS Iyengar was the consummate yogi ... supremely skilled, and the true master of his craft. But master also means one who has </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>control of something, as Guruji indeed gained over my heart so long ago.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It took me a long time, and much contemplation, but I did indeed find the perfect title for the book I did for my Guru for he is indeed "Iyengar the Yoga Master".</DIV>
