Thank you Gurujiâ€¦
In 1983 at 39 years old I went to Pune with a group from the USA for an intensive. I was nervous.  Arriving at the institute for my first class, Guruji happened to be at the gate entrance, he may have been saying goodbye to some friends or guests. We connected with our eyes to greet each other, the warmth and light coming from his eyes allowed all the tension to leave my body/mind, I felt accepted and welcomed, and had a wonderful yoga intensive.  My yoga journey continues to this day.

In light and spirit of yoga
