<div dir="ltr"><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">Dear Geetaji and Prashantji,</div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">Thank you very much for asking for contributions towards a memoir of dearest Guruji.  The attached candid photo of Guruji with myself on his 91st birthday in 2009, which was my first trip to India and first time at RIMYI, is perhaps my very favorite photo ever as the person who snapped it was unknown to me. She just caught that precious moment and came up to me afterwards and said, &quot;I think I have a photo you are going to want...&quot;  Perhaps with a little cropping it might be suitable for your publication.  I love Guruji&#39;s warm smile and the movement in me as I was turning towards him.  He is always, always in my heart.</div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">And here are two short anecdotes I can share:<br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">I had been to RIMYI the same month as Patricia Walden and I came to find out it would be her last morning at practice with Guruji.  When I became aware she had left the hall, I looked over at Guruji who was still in the hall.  He was on the far side of the hall from the entrance sitting on top of a back-bender, the feet-side of which was facing towards the window, in something like Dandasana.  He was looking out the window and the expression on his face was one of a person attempting to not shed tears.  <br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">Another day I had come to the lobby of RIMYI in the afternoon to find Guruji engaged with a gathering group of different students.  Some were longtime students saying their good-byes, and some others were passing through, wanting to get Guruji&#39;s signature on some books.  I remember him saying something like &quot;they have to learn to wait.&quot;  I had just promptly found a spot and knelt down on the floor to just watch him greet all these people.  Eventually all were nearly gone and then I noticed he looked at me and nodded and beckoned me forward.  I froze, as I had nothing planned, and then instinctively I just put a hand on my heart, bowed my head, then shook my head so he would know there was nothing I wanted to ask, and then folded my palms together.  Quite the memorable experience for me even though no words were exchanged.  </div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">Thank you for your consideration.  Humbly submitted,</div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">Kristine Bell</div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">New York City</div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small">U.S.A.</div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div><div class="gmail_default" style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:small"><br></div></div>
