Grateful for Guruji 
By Deni Roman
Maui, Hawaii USA

August, 2011 at 9:00am I arrived early for the ladies class. Guruji was sitting at the office desk fresh and open to receive his students. I shared with him that I had traveled to Sri Ramanamaharshi Ashram and Sri Aurobindo Ashram and was feeling emotional and spiritually confused. I told Guruji I was brought up Jewish but my parents did not instill in me a strong relationship with God. They did teach me however to stand on my own two feet in the world and that is why I love standing poses. Guruji smiled ear to ear. I went on to tell him that I have always felt connected to Krishna and the Bhagavad Gita. That I have Krishna consciousness. He surprised me by saying, "That's ridiculous. Do you think of your parents everyday?" I told him I think of them, but not daily. His reply was, "From the moment you wake up in the morning think of God all day until you go to bed." In a flash moment all confusion dissolved. He looked at me with my watery eyes and said, "I did it myself and so can you."
