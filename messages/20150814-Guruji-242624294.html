Dear Geetaji and Prashantji,

I received your mail on August 11. 
I would like to contribute to the December 2015 release. When Rajvi Mehta was in my house in Brussels earlier this year, she was very enthusiast mainly about my pictures of London, Crystal Palace 1993   but also  of the Panchgani ones.

I am willing to share them but can not find material to scan and time before August 15. I might have a possibility next week or it will be beginning of September.
I have a full album. Some help could be to know your priority choices. Guruji teaching or demonstrating, with old students, laughing , receiving award or signing books, alone on stage with one or two people, big group, planting a tree? A huge yoga demonstration?

With love, respect and dedication,
Viviane Gutlerner
