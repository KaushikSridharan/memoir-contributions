Mine will stay with me always.<div>&nbsp;<div>I was encouraged in 1993, after only 2 years of studying Iyengar yoga with my wonderful first teacher in the UK, to attend the 1993 convention in London where BKS Iyengar was going to be teaching. I was such a raw beginner I don’t know where I got the courage! But along I went. The event was incredible for me to experience and at my first glimpse of Guruji on the stage surrounded by his entourage (I remember Manouso, Jean Maslen, Diane Clifton and others) I was entranced. My poor stiff body had no idea what it was doing but suddenly over 1000 of us were in Trikonasana and I wondered how I was ever going to survive! I couldn’t see Guruji anymore but could hear his voice through the loud speakers as he gave us gem after gem of instruction while he went round the huge arena. Then suddenly, someone was adjusting my pose - it was Guruji - it felt to me as if his hands were made of pure light so that the muscles, the flesh and even the cells of my body released into the shape of the pose and I no longer felt any tiredness or stiffness. &nbsp;At that moment, my life changed forever and I can’t express in words the profound effect that his teaching has had on me since then.</div><div><br></div><div><div apple-content-edited="true">
