<div dir="ltr"><div>Guruji was so in the moment that he could be especially compassionate 
with children.  I loved to watch how he would work with Guarika.  She, 
being so precocious,  was filled with enthusiasm when Guruji was there 
to work with her, and would accept almost any challenge he brought to 
her.  Her delight in yoga met his, to removed the physical, 
psychological barriers so that he was spiritually connected to her.   In
 a small aside, he asked what I saw in her, and he allowed me to see 
that she had up-liftment from inside.  She was very happy to know that 
it was not only her experience, but that he could understand that in 
her, and that I could feel that through observations he wanted us to 
see.  He was that kind of extraordinary teacher that brought you right 
into the present moment.  Alone, I would not have had that keenness of 
observation, but he made us keen.<br><br></div>Laurel Thomas Laulkar<br></div>
