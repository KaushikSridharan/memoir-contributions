Dear RIMYI family,

Here are our contributions for the memoir project. 

'Guruji Memorial’ is something I wrote for our community on Facebook just after Guruji passed. It is something I hoped would help at the time. It is not as polished as the later article as we were all a bit raw and that time.

'Guruji’s Other Forms' is an article I wrote about 6 months after Guruji passed; it is a more polished piece. Many were feeling downcast, alone and not knowing what to do or how to continue. I wrote it hoping it would help connect people to Guruji with both inspirational and practical advice they could use to continue on the path he has shown even though he is no longer here in physical form. 

You may edit as needed. 

With my teacher’s encouragement I created the American Iyengar Yoga Archives and worked on it for 20 years. Here is a link to 19 photos you may find interesting. I am looking for one more photo which I took that is not in the archives. If I find it, I will send it along with a short story.

We look forward to seeing you all in December. 

Namaskar,

Eddy Marks &amp; Mary Obendorfer
