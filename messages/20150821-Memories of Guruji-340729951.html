<div dir="ltr"><div>Dear Geetaji, Prashantji and everyone in the Iyengar family, </div><div> </div><div>Namaste. </div><div> </div><div>My name is Ainhoa Acosta and I love in London, UK. I first met Guruji when my now husband and I attended the celebrations for Guruji&#39;s 90th Birthday in Pune, Bellur and Mysore. It was our first time in India together and a trip that will always be in my heart. During the lunch reception in Pune, as we ate dessert (it was Carrot Halwa, and it tasted like nectar). Guruji has greeting every single person in the gardens. He stopped as he reached our place, to speak to Raja. I didn&#39;t know whether I should stop eating, get up or just do nothing: he was Guruji Iyengar! The man whose yoga I started practising out of Light on Yoga and who I never thought I would meet! When they finished talking, Guruji turned to us, quickly, smiled and asked: &#39;Are you enjoying yourselves?&#39; I never expected that kind of question from him and to me, it meant that this man was someone who was down to earth, who loved life, and loved living. He was a true ray of light. </div><div> </div><div>Later on, in 2012, after my first trip to study in Pune, I had a dream, about a month after arriving back in the UK:</div><div> </div><div>I entered the RMIYI library and Guruji was there, dressed in white, sitting at the bench (where students sit, not at the desk), by himself. He was reading quite a large book, very absorbed in it. I hesitated, but he motioned me to come closer &#39;come, come: sit with me&#39;, he said. I sat next to him. &#39;Look: do you see?&#39; I looked into the book and the most fantastical colours, shapes and creations were there, coming out of the book: vibrant colours, fantastical shapes, all of staggering beauty. We looked together into the book and then he said: &#39;Do you see? Do you understand it now?&#39; I woke up from that dream feeling elated and with a very strong, very clear sense of what it meant: Guruji teaches us to <em>see,</em> to really see beauty in everything and every one. This dream has stayed with me every single day since then.</div><div> </div><div>Guruji is there with me every day, at practice and in my life. I am committed, from my heart, to practise the way he taught us in my small and humble way.</div><div> </div><div>With love and gratitude, </div><div> </div><div>Ainhoa</div><div> </div></div>
