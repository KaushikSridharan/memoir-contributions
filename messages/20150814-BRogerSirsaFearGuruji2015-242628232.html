Iyengar Banishes My Fear in Sirsasana<br>by Bruce M. Roger<br>[photo: BR_BKS_Sirsa1-84.jpg]<br><br>August 14, 2015<br><br>Re: Guruji2015 anecdote submission<br><br><guruji2015@rimyi.org><br><br>During the first week of the January, 1984 Intensive Course taught by Geetaji, we were expected to balance in Sirsasana in the middle of the room for ten minutes. I had practiced it — leaning against a wall — for only about a month. I was terrified of falling. <br><br>Unbeknownst to me, Guruji had started to silently adjust students. When he tried to straighten me out, I struggled to remain upright. Knocking me over he growled, “How dare you resist!” I thought, “Oh, no! My mother told me not to come here, and now Guruji is mad at me.” <br><br>Seeking redemption, I looked him in the eye and responded, “Let’s try it again.” He lifted me up, took me through all the twisting variations with a grace and lightness I’d never felt before, and then said softly, “You can come down now.” With his deft touch, my fear vanished and I never sought the security of the wall again. <br><br>A week or two later he asked for a demonstrator to make a point. With nothing to lose, I eagerly raised my hand, “I’ll do it.” “The worst one!” he countered. Then he taught how to lift the inner heels, as I struggled to do in the photo.<br><br>His delight was in serving others. He was a giant among men. It’s hard to imagine the world without our Guruji, B.K.S. Iyengar.<br><br>May his memory be a blessing.<br></guruji2015@rimyi.org></div><br><hr><br><div style="font-size:12px;color:black;"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhDwAPAOMAAP///zEwYmJlzQAAAPr6+vv7+/7+/vb29pyZ//39/YOBg////////////////////ywAAAAADwAPAAAESRDISUG4lQYr+s5bIEwDUWictA2GdBjhaAGDrKZzjYq3PgUw2co24+VGLYAAAesRLQklxoeiUDUI0qSj6EoH4Iuoq6B0PQJyJQIAOw==">
