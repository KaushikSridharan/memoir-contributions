Dear Ann,
Thank you for getting this organized. It is wonderful to re-read and remember that day. He always taught a lesson and never missed an opportunity to do it. There are some really valuable points he made in this one. 

Love,
Linda

Dear Geetaji and Prashantji,

I am attaching an article with photographs which have never been published of Guruji.
Because Guruji allowed the photos to be taken to show a specific person,  we published the article in the Iyengar Yoga Centre of Victoria newsletter, spring, 2014 edition, but the photographs were not included.
We also have a few photographs of Guruji in niralamba halasana which he allowed us to take.
We  would like to offer the photographs and article to you for inclusion (if you feel the piece is suitable) in the tribute publication for Guruji.
If you would like any of the photographs in higher resolution, I would be happy to forward these to you in separate emails along with the photographs of Guruji in niralamba halasana.
Every day memories of Guruji's presence, his life and Light continue to surface and to guide us on the path of Yoga.

With much gratitude and affection,

Ann Kilbertus
