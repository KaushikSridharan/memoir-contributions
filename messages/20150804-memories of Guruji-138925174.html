<div class="moz-text-flowed">Dear Geetaji and Prashantji,
<br>
<br>In answer to your request for memories of Guruji, I wrote this piece for 
Dipika, Maida Vale's magazine, and circulated it widely amongst my 
students and yoga friends.
<br>
<br>Best wishes
<br>

<br>
<br>I started yoga in 1976 due to arthritis at a young age. I was very stiff 
and uneven, and my teachers saw that I presented a difficult teaching 
challenge and sought Mr Iyengar's advice at the earliest opportunity. 
When he came he used to run small classes for people with medical 
problems, and I went to one of those with Diana Clifton, my teacher, at 
the old Maida Vale Institute. There we saw those with other problems 
being helped too (one young man recovering from a bad motor bike crash 
with an injured brain, I remember).
<br>
<br>At the large convention style gathering at Porchester Hall (300 people?) 
we were all taught in one room, with the senior teachers and Mr Iyengar 
all on the stage. It gave us a very good idea of what yoga was about and 
what we were aiming for, inspiring us all. When he came to Quentin 
Kynaston School in Hampstead we were subdivided into smaller classes 
which he visited in turn with a very small entourage - that was less 
scary. He said that we are all natural people so not to treat him 
specially (with awe). He worked very fast and moved on when he saw that 
we were out of our depth and unable to keep up with him any longer. He 
came back later when we had recovered our poise (and ability to learn!). 
He showed us some fascinating things - like improving Sarvangasana with 
two judicious placed biro pens, and straightening a bent little finger 
in dog pose by pressing his big toe down on a specific spot. He asked 
one lady "When was your hysterectomy?". She said "How did you know?" - 
he replied "The first ninety nine were difficult but the hundredth was 
easy" (poor lady being singled out we thought!). He happened to be at 
the Institute during a teachers' workshop where someone was adjusting me 
in dog head down. He said "Not like that - can't you see that you will 
break her bones?". Oh no, we all thought!
<br>
<br>He gave Question and Answer sessions where he brilliantly made silk 
purses out of the sows ears of our questions, and told us what we had 
not realised that we wanted to know!&nbsp; At Maida Vale he gave a talk on 
Pranayama which went on for hours as a continuous flow of thought - 
whilst we struggled to sit upright. Later he wanted us to grasp better 
that yoga was for mind, body, and soul, and introduced chanting the 
invocation before class.
<br>
<br>At the Barbican demonstration and the Crystal Palace Convention the 
informality had largely gone as the numbers were huge, and Mr Iyengar 
had a large entourage. He was trying to impart main stream yoga to 
improve our grounding in the subject (from our poses he saw what we had 
grasped and what was missing...). There were less fascinating aside 
remarks!
<br>
<br>In 1992 Lorna Walker and I started workshops to raise funds to put on a 
programme of yoga days and occasional medical classes, to support the 
many teachers' adult education classes in North East London (as had been 
done at Maida Vale a few years earlier). We wrote to tell him and Mr 
Iyengar said call yourselves North East London Iyengar Yoga Institute 
(NELIYI), and get help from Diana Clifton and Genie Hammond to run the 
medical classes (who very kindly gave their time free).
<br>
<br>Also in 1992 I first went to Pune to attend medical classes. It was a 
bewildering experience - you needed a helper teacher to take in all the 
information and show how to practice with the props as directed. I found 
it very difficult and said so, he replied "Don't you think that I found 
it very difficult too, and with no-one to show me how?!". I was slowly 
improving, and he had become "Guruji". In subsequent visits I attended 
general classes and Guruji asked me to help a colleague in medical 
classes. We took photos of her programme so we could get it right at 
home. This pattern was repeated on subsequent visits, including twice 
when I took my husband first with Myasthenia Gravis (muscle weakness) 
and then what turned out to be Motor Neurone Disease. He showed what to 
do and how to help, and continued to offer kindness and advice. This 
advice and yoga itself was invaluable for the rest of my husband's life, 
and made all the difference to our confidence, and how to use aids and 
adaptations. What a privilege.
<br>
<br>The effect Guruji has had on my life is rare and incalculable, all along 
he made the impossible possible for me and my husband. Huge respect is 
due to a true yoga master, who knew his worth, but was also humble, 
engaging, humorous, honest, and above all compassionate and kind.
