<br>&nbsp;Namaste
<br>&nbsp;I am sending you a message from Geetaji and Prashantji. I request you
<br>[especially the representatives of the Associations] to forward it to
<br>other fellow practitioners.
<br>&nbsp;Regards
<br>&nbsp;Rajvi
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Dear friends and fellow practitioners,
<br>
<br>&nbsp;It has been almost a year since our beloved Guruji passed away. He
<br>remains in our hearts and continues to guide us along our path.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;We are sure you all have many fond memories of Guruji. Some of you
<br>may have anecdotes, remembrances, or even lighthearted or humorous
<br>incidents with Guruji that you want to relate; or you may have poems
<br>or tributes that you have composed; or perhaps you have photographs of
<br>Guruji, or pieces of art that you have created. We are planning to put
<br>together a memoir to be released on December 14th this year, and we
<br>would like to have these for inclusion in the memoir.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Please send in your contributions to <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:guruji2015@rimyi.org">guruji2015@rimyi.org</a>. We will
<br>try to include as much material as we can, but we may have to limit
<br>what we can use for editorial reasons. Please make sure your
<br>contributions are in by August 15th, 2015, so that we have enough time
<br>to allow for the editing and printing process. Contributions in
<br>English, Hindi or Marathi are welcome. If you speak some other
<br>language, feel free to send in translations.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Yours affectionately,
<br>
<br>&nbsp;Geeta and Prashant
