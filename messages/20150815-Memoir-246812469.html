Dear Geeta, Prashant, and Those in the project.
Here are two short memories.
I will send a photo next to go with it, but it is a picture of the picture. I am traveling now and will be home in 2 weeks . At that time I can send a scanned pic or another one.
Thank you, see you in December.
At his feet,
Carolyn

Guruji gave intense generosity and generous intensity!
This is thought that came to the heart the first time at the Institute in 1995. Guruji had given me a certain way to do Sirsasana with a trifold mat and then folded again -a six fold!  Balance on that was a must and somehow became steady when he was there. Two days later in the pose he walks by and says " Who told you to do that high!" What choice but to say nothing , feel the play and give a respectful chuckle to one's self!  He said, "enough now 1/2 of that"and gave the famous one eyebrow up smile. The moment in playful connection remains imprinted in the cave of this heart.
" Go with courage and caution." Guruji would tell me when taking leave from him to go home.
