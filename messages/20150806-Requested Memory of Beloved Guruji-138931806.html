<div>In 2001 I was scheduled at RIMYI for a two month stay through October and November. This ended up being a most fortunate time to be in Pune which came out of the unfortunate September 11 tragedy in New York City. Because of that event, the hall was quite empty as people weren’t really traveling. Practice sessions were just a handful of us which allowed for precious and uncluttered space to be near Guruji.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On this day in particular, Guruji was practicing standing asanas near and at the tressler. I didn’t see exactly what happened, but Guruji lost his balance and&nbsp;I saw&nbsp;the last moment as he fell and heard him tumble onto the floor. Several assistants rushed to his aid but he brushed everyone off with a flick of his hand. As he stood up with his hair disheveled he was laughing heartily, hands on hips&nbsp;and we all realized he was absolutely fine.&nbsp;“Thank God!”, I remember thinking. </div><div><br></div><div>In the next instant he held up his right index finger pointing upwards and still smiling he reported with&nbsp;emphasis,&nbsp;“The Yogi is <em>he</em> who has conquered the pride!” </div><div><br></div><div>The images, sounds and message of witnessing this are all a positive smrti for me. We all have many of them with our beloved Guruji and this one vibrates in my heart from time to time, encouraging me to practice with vigor, honesty but most importantly humility. And not to worry about&nbsp;“looking good” in front of others. If the great BKS Iyengar didn’t mind, why should I? What a lesson! </div><div><br></div><div>Love, <br>Lisa Jo Landsberg</div><div>Junior Intermediate III</div><div>IYNAUS Ethics Committee &amp; Scholarship Committee Member </div><div>Boulder Colorado USA </div><div><a href="mailto:lisajland@hotmail.com">lisajland@hotmail.com</a></div><div><a href="http://www.pearlsofwisdomyoga.com">www.pearlsofwisdomyoga.com</a> </div><div>mobile +1.303.570.0123</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
